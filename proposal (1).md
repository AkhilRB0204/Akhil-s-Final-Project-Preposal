# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Star Shooter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game in which the The rocket shoots out astericks and astericks can be collected along the way to add more ammo to the rocket. The whole point of the rocket is to shoot asteriods(big chunks), if it gets hit by an asteroid, then it's games over.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In the software, users will be able to move the rocket around by slidng it around with their fingers on touchscreen for touch screen devices or trackpad for computers. The user can make the rocket collect astericks on the way which will add one more shooter to the rocket. For example, the rocket shoots 4 astericks at default but when the user collect 1 asterick, the rocket can shoot one more asterick. The user will be able to choose between 6 skins for the rocket. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

One good outcome for this project is for the software to at least allow the rocket to be moved around to shoot out astericks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I might be able to do everything I planned with this project by the due date.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to at least enable the user to more around the rockets like at least make sure that I accomplish the main goal of this game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn about how to create a code that will enable the rocket to be moved around, kind of like a cursor. Another skill I will have to acquire is to create a code that can make the rocket shoot out laser bullet and be able to shoot one more laser bullet for every asterick it collects. I will have to learn to develop a code that allows asteroids to come from the top of the screen. All of this will require me looking at tutorials and ideas of other that share some traits of this projecy.
